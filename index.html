							Dynamic-DEN速 is the FLEX-time software of choice for Cascade Middle School, Skyview Middle School, and Pacific Crest Middle School in Bend, OR. It allows you to:
							<ul>
								<li>Track student attendance - know your students are where they are supposed to be!</li>
								<li>Create and manage activities in seconds</li>
								<li>Easily limit the number of participants for activities</li>
								<li>Painlessly manage your school's roster</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<strong>But what is FLEX-time?</strong><br>
							FLEX-time is also commonly known as a Response to Intervention (RTI) program. RTI is a school of thought that enables struggling students to get the help they need during school hours. Schools might have 1-3 "flexible" periods per week, where students can either choose an activity (like art or ping-pong) or have one assigned to them, if they need to bring a grade up. <br><br>
							
							RTI programs are showing up more and more in schools of all levels around the nation, but many schools try to manage scheduling through tedious spreadsheets - that is, they try and do it manually. With Dynamic-DEN速, all the hard work is done for you. You don't need faculty to double- and triple-check that students aren't signing up for the Gaming Club instead of the Math Workshop. You don't need to clear pages of activities so students can sign up again. You don't need to worry that 60 students will sign up for one activity, overloading the teacher overseeing them. <br><br>
							
							<strong>Get Dynamic-DEN速, so the hard part is done for you.</strong>
